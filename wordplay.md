**A Lafayette Evening** <br>
Dear Lafayette, <br>
I gazed on your western horizon, <br>
when the painter of the evening <br>
kept mixing its colors on the ethereal <br>
canvas turning it gold, orange, and darker orange. <br>
Upon the base of ever-darkening <br>
silhouette of trees and houses, <br>
Countless twinkle of earthly stars came to life.

Griffin Hall on my right and a rooftop lamp-post <br>
on my left framed my field of vision <br>
on the canvas of now invisible painter. <br>
From the upper left, a lone star stared down at me <br>
And the Lunar crescent of the day two graced the center <br>
as the painter headed to Eastern hemisphere. 

My mother would soak barley and corn <br>
and wish for a clear sky as she would wait <br>
for a glimpse of the same lunar crescent to dig the holy soil <br>
and make a tiny seedbed for the jamara. <br>
I feel the soft golden shoots of barley and corn, <br>
On the blurry border of the blue and orange. <br>

**Beads** <br>
Johnston Street is different tonight <br>
Regular wheels are not flashing <br>
It teems with whole bunch of people <br>
Didn't know this place sheltered so many souls 

White, blue, purple, gold, green, red, and what not <br>
Were those beads  <br>
The crew of carnival flung them in both directions, <br>
I caught some of them in the mid air <br>
Romped with joy <br>
Thought I got something substantial <br>
Put them on my neck 

One, two, three, … nineteen…twenty… <br>
I stopped counting <br>
Each catch adding up to my ecstasy  <br>
Piling up around my neck

The cool, smooth roundness of the beads  <br>
Caressed my open nape <br>
And rolled over my breast <br>
With each step, and jump I made  <br>
The beads would jostle as if to tear  <br>
the fabric of my shirt and be one with me

I couldn't catch all of them, <br>
I pine for the beads I tried to catch <br>
But someone else grabbed before me <br>
Or I misjudged the distance and they hit the ground <br>
I was too proud to pick them up <br>
If only I could reverse the time <br>
And secure those missed moments <br>
Which keep on pinching my heart with remorse

Now the parade is over <br>
A kid jumps over the barricade  <br>
Picks up the beads scattered on the street <br>
Handful, he runs to his parents to show the treasure <br>
But what should I do with this neck-full of beads? <br>
Carried them back to my abode <br>
Put them on the table <br>
Made a heart of a pink one <br>
And sent it to my little girl <br>
And got one in return <br>
The string feels long enough  <br>
To keep the distant beads in touch! <br>

**Haiku-3** <br>
A wtilight sets on <br>
Brearded tress and lapping waves <br>
When framed through a lens <br>

**Haiku-1** <br>
Devkota once said <br>
Man is great by heart not caste <br>
Do you feel that way? <br>

Sleet crystals settle <br>
On a pebble bed and ask <br>
For a snow blanket <br>
