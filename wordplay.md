[**Morning run**](https://sarbagya.substack.com/p/morning-run)  <br>
Taps of acorns woke me up early morning— <br>
My fleeting feet on the crunchy leaves <br>
Broke the silence of the slanted rays <br>
Filtered through the boles and boughs— <br>
A chipmunk nibbling its nutty breakfast <br>
Greeted me with its furry tail— <br>

**Smuggled Buddha** <br>

By a white statue of the  little Buddha,<br>
I folded  my legs to strike a lotus pose,<br>
And faced another humongous red Buddha <br>
In the glass-caged temple in front of me. 

That was just to click myself in a picture <br>
and to incarnate on the click-farms  of Metaverse. 

The marble inscription of the temple said:<br>
This statue was stolen from China <br>
And then smuggled to New York <br>
Then bought by Louisiana <br>
And installed on Avery Island.

Now I wonder: <br>
In this transoceanic theft of Buddha, <br>
What portion of Four Noble Truths, <br>
What amount of compassion and self-knowledge <br>
Did they smuggle in here? <br>
If they had managed any, <br>
Did they trap them in the same glass cage?<br>

**Dream Bubble** <br>
At the sprightly site of these soap bubbles, my heart took off to the distant land and even more distant past. Here I was strolling at the Girard Park next to my university. There, I avoided the eyes of my parents and sometimes of my two elder sisters, to sneak out of my home onto the street. The street was unpaved and sparsely fenced with the sajiwans. With Spring, the sajiwans had new foliage of tempting leaves of a palm size with a slender finger-length of its petiole. I selected a promising leaf and plucked it from the base of its petiole with an extra caution not to break it otherwise. Then I snapped the petiole near the base of the blade making sure not to break the lower portion of its skin. Thus, I formed a tiny triangle which was filled instantly by a fragile film of transparent sap. Before it formed a droplet, I circled my lips into an O and gently blew right onto the sap triangle—a marble size bubble popped out of the triangle. Aha! My mission accomplished! The dreamy, transparent, and glistening bubble drifted a while in the air. I started chasing after it and touched it out of its existence. As it disappeared, a tiny droplet landed on my white Amul t-shirt and made an indelible dream-mark. I outgrew that t-shirt, but not the memory of the bubble mark. <br>

**A Lafayette Evening** <br>
Dear Lafayette, <br>
I gazed on your western horizon, <br>
when the painter of the evening <br>
kept mixing its colors on the ethereal <br>
canvas turning it gold, orange, and darker orange. <br>
Upon the base of ever-darkening <br>
silhouette of trees and houses, <br>
Countless twinkle of earthly stars came to life.

Griffin Hall on my right and a rooftop lamp-post <br>
on my left framed my field of vision <br>
on the canvas of now invisible painter. <br>
From the upper left, a lone star stared down at me <br>
And the Lunar crescent of the day two graced the center <br>
as the painter headed to Eastern hemisphere. 

My mother would soak barley and corn <br>
and wish for a clear sky as she would wait <br>
for a glimpse of the same lunar crescent to dig the holy soil <br>
and make a tiny seedbed for the _jamara_. <br>
I feel the soft golden shoots of barley and corn, <br>
On the blurry border of the blue and orange. <br>

**Joseph, Morlfort, and Reed** <br/>
Joseph, Milfort, and Reed<br/>
T w e n t y 	y e a r s … <br/>
Perhaps with d’Anville’s maps in his hands,<br/>  
Milfort travelled<br/>
Jan. 1775 <br/>
France, Dunkirk, Norway, Bergen<br/>
Apr. 1775 <br/>
USA, New London, Connecticut, Boston, New York, Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, York Town of Virginia, two Carolinas, Savannah of Gorgia, River Augusta, Orangeburg South Carolina, . . . 
      
among<br/>
the savage nations of North America <br/>
served as the war chief of Creek Nations <br/>
with no intention to write a novel <br/>
promised to lay bare the fact about <br/>
savages too close to nature, <br/>
still in the cradle of nature,<br/>
without writing, <br/>
without any means of dissimulation <br/>
Elder Creeks showed him their <br/>
belts and chaplets “their archives” <br/>
different arrangement pattern told different stories <br/>
Milfort resented a pastoral account to Napoleon <br/>
What an asset would these people and the region for his home country? <br/>

Five days west from St. Bernard Parish <br/>
One hour after sunrise Milfort encountered the Atakapa, <br/>
A misnomer from the Spaniards <br/>   
A European Joseph among them <br/>
Had spent  e l e v e n      y e a r s  among them wanted more 

Centuries later, Marthe Reed, steers her poetic ark  <br/>
In La Louisane, <br/>
She read Milfort who met Joseph <br/>
How different are her memories? <br/>  
The forests Milfort and Joseph navigated <br/>
Were no more so <br/>
Technologies and toxics changed the region<br/>
She meditates upon this change, as an insider, as an outsider. <br/>

**Beads** <br>
Johnston Street is different tonight <br>
Regular wheels are not flashing <br>
It teems with whole bunch of people <br>
Didn't know this place sheltered so many souls 

White, blue, purple, gold, green, red, and what not <br>
Were those beads  <br>
The crew of carnival flung them in both directions, <br>
I caught some of them in the mid air <br>
Romped with joy <br>
Thought I got something substantial <br>
Put them on my neck 

One, two, three, … nineteen…twenty… <br>
I stopped counting <br>
Each catch adding up to my ecstasy  <br>
Piling up around my neck

The cool, smooth roundness of the beads  <br>
Caressed my open nape <br>
And rolled over my breast <br>
With each step, and jump I made  <br>
The beads would jostle as if to tear  <br>
the fabric of my shirt and be one with me

I couldn't catch all of them, <br>
I pine for the beads I tried to catch <br>
But someone else grabbed before me <br>
Or I misjudged the distance and they hit the ground <br>
I was too proud to pick them up <br>
If only I could reverse the time <br>
And secure those missed moments <br>
Which keep on pinching my heart with remorse

Now the parade is over <br>
A kid jumps over the barricade  <br>
Picks up the beads scattered on the street <br>
Handful, he runs to his parents to show the treasure <br>
But what should I do with this neck-full of beads? <br>
Carried them back to my abode <br>
Put them on the table <br>
Made a heart of a pink one <br>
And sent it to my little girl <br>
And got one in return <br>
The string feels long enough  <br>
To keep the distant beads in touch! <br>

**Haiku-3** <br>
A twilight sets on <br>
Bearded tress and lapping waves <br>
When framed through a lens <br>

**Haiku-1** <br>
Devkota once said <br>
Man is great by heart not caste <br>
Do you feel that way? <br>

**Haiku-0** <br>
Sleet crystals settle <br>
On a pebble bed and ask <br>
For a snow blanket <br>

**Arrival** <br>
When the tune of Sarswati's _bina_ <br>
Mingled with the music of nine muses <br>

When Kalidasha's cloud messenger <br>
Crossed the oceans to trigger the west wind of Shelley 

When the oriental mystical universal self <br>
Permeated Plotinus's One and <br>
Transcended Emerson's Over soul <br>
To condense into a drop on Whitman's blade of grass,

I find myself morphed into a purple petal of Jacaranda <br>
That maneuvered not to join the piling blanket on the turf, <br>
Instead took flight on the wings of Oryx and <br>
Joined the tap of acorn at this southern yard of Uncle Sam. <br>
