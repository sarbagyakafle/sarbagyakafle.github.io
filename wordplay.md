**Dream Bubble** <br>
At the sprightly site of these soap bubbles, my heart took off to the distant land and even more distant past. Here I was strolling at the Girard Park next to my university. There, I avoided the eyes of my parents and sometimes of my two elder sisters, to sneak out of my home onto the street. The street was unpaved and sparsely fenced with the sajiwans. With Spring, the sajiwans had new foliage of tempting leaves of a palm size with a slender finger-length of its petiole. I selected a promising leaf and plucked it from the base of its petiole with an extra caution not to break it otherwise. Then I snapped the petiole near the base of the blade making sure not to break the lower portion of its skin. Thus, I formed a tiny triangle which was filled instantly by a fragile film of transparent sap. Before it formed a droplet, I circled my lips into an O and gently blew right onto the sap triangle—a marble size bubble popped out of the triangle. Aha! My mission accomplished! The dreamy, transparent, and glistening bubble drifted a while in the air. I started chasing after it and touched it out of its existence. As it disappeared, a tiny droplet landed on my white Amul t-shirt and made an indelible dream-mark. I outgrew that t-shirt, but not the memory of the bubble mark. <br>

**A Lafayette Evening** <br>
Dear Lafayette, <br>
I gazed on your western horizon, <br>
when the painter of the evening <br>
kept mixing its colors on the ethereal <br>
canvas turning it gold, orange, and darker orange. <br>
Upon the base of ever-darkening <br>
silhouette of trees and houses, <br>
Countless twinkle of earthly stars came to life.

Griffin Hall on my right and a rooftop lamp-post <br>
on my left framed my field of vision <br>
on the canvas of now invisible painter. <br>
From the upper left, a lone star stared down at me <br>
And the Lunar crescent of the day two graced the center <br>
as the painter headed to Eastern hemisphere. 

My mother would soak barley and corn <br>
and wish for a clear sky as she would wait <br>
for a glimpse of the same lunar crescent to dig the holy soil <br>
and make a tiny seedbed for the _jamara_. <br>
I feel the soft golden shoots of barley and corn, <br>
On the blurry border of the blue and orange. <br>

**Beads** <br>
Johnston Street is different tonight <br>
Regular wheels are not flashing <br>
It teems with whole bunch of people <br>
Didn't know this place sheltered so many souls 

White, blue, purple, gold, green, red, and what not <br>
Were those beads  <br>
The crew of carnival flung them in both directions, <br>
I caught some of them in the mid air <br>
Romped with joy <br>
Thought I got something substantial <br>
Put them on my neck 

One, two, three, … nineteen…twenty… <br>
I stopped counting <br>
Each catch adding up to my ecstasy  <br>
Piling up around my neck

The cool, smooth roundness of the beads  <br>
Caressed my open nape <br>
And rolled over my breast <br>
With each step, and jump I made  <br>
The beads would jostle as if to tear  <br>
the fabric of my shirt and be one with me

I couldn't catch all of them, <br>
I pine for the beads I tried to catch <br>
But someone else grabbed before me <br>
Or I misjudged the distance and they hit the ground <br>
I was too proud to pick them up <br>
If only I could reverse the time <br>
And secure those missed moments <br>
Which keep on pinching my heart with remorse

Now the parade is over <br>
A kid jumps over the barricade  <br>
Picks up the beads scattered on the street <br>
Handful, he runs to his parents to show the treasure <br>
But what should I do with this neck-full of beads? <br>
Carried them back to my abode <br>
Put them on the table <br>
Made a heart of a pink one <br>
And sent it to my little girl <br>
And got one in return <br>
The string feels long enough  <br>
To keep the distant beads in touch! <br>

**Smuggled Buddha** <br>
By a scaled down white statue of Buddha, <br>
I fold  my legs to pose a padmasana like <br>
the larger-than-life red statue of Buddha <br>
in the glass-cage temple in front of me, <br>
to click myself in a picture <br>
and to incarnate on social media. 

Stone inscription of the premise says: <br>
This statue was stolen from China <br>
And then smuggled to New York <br>
Louisiana bought it <br>
And installed on Avery Island. 

I wonder:<br> 
When they stole the statue of Buddha,<br>
What portion of eight-fold paths<br>
Did they smuggle? <br>
If they had managed any, <br>
Did they trap them in the same glass cage? <br>

**Haiku-3** <br>
A wtilight sets on <br>
Brearded tress and lapping waves <br>
When framed through a lens <br>

**Haiku-1** <br>
Devkota once said <br>
Man is great by heart not caste <br>
Do you feel that way? <br>

**Haiku-0** <br>
Sleet crystals settle <br>
On a pebble bed and ask <br>
For a snow blanket <br>

**Arrival** <br>
When the tune of Sarswati's _bina_ <br>
Mingled with the music of nine muses <br>

When Kalidasha's cloud messenger <br>
Crossed the oceans to trigger the west wind of Shelley 

When the oriental mystical universal self <br>
Permeated Plotinus's One and <br>
Transcended Emerson's Over soul <br>
To condense into a drop on Whitman's blade of grass,

I find myself morphed into a purple petal of Jacaranda <br>
That maneuvered not to join the piling blanket on the turf, <br>
Instead took flight on the wings of Orix and <br>
Joined the tap of acorn at this southern yard of Uncle Sam. <br>
