**A Lafayette Evening **

Dear Lafayette, <br>
I gazed on your western horizon, <br>
when the painter of the evening <br>
kept mixing its colors on the ethereal <br>
canvas turning it gold, orange, and darker orange. <br>
Upon the base of ever-darkening <br>
silhouette of trees and houses, <br>
Countless twinkle of earthly stars came to life.

Griffin Hall on my right and a rooftop lamp-post <br>
on my left framed my field of vision <br>
on the canvas of now invisible painter. <br>
From the upper left, a lone star stared down at me <br>
And the Lunar crescent of the day two graced the center <br>
as the painter headed to Eastern hemisphere. 

My mother would soak barley and corn <br>
and wish for a clear sky as she would wait <br>
for a glimpse of the same lunar crescent to dig the holy soil <br>
and make a tiny seedbed for the jamara. <br>
I feel the soft golden shoots of barley and corn, <br>
On the blurry border of the blue and orange. <br>

A wtilight sets on <br>
Brearded tress and lapping waves <br>
When framed through a lens <br>

Devkota once said <br>
Man is great by heart not caste <br>
Do you feel that way? <br>

Sleet crystals settle <br>
On a pebble bed and ask <br>
For a snow blanket <br>
