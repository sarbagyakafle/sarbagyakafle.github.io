I am a teacher and researcher of rhetoric, writing, and literature with a PhD in English (rhetoric and composition) from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. My areas of interest include transnational rhetorical circulation, digital rhetoric, first-year composition, folklore, and American literature.
