Everett’s James “reimagines” one of the most quintessential American classics, Twain’s _Huck Finn_, a novel that, in Earnest Hemingway’s words, marked the beginning of all modern American literature. Everett’s narrator, Jim—who reinscribes himself as James—tells the story of the antebellum South in his amphibian escapade along the bends of the Mississippi.
